# Actuarial Science Roadmap: From Beginner to Expert

## Introduction
Actuarial science is a multidisciplinary field that applies mathematics, statistics, finance, and programming to assess and manage risk. Actuaries work in insurance, pensions, investment, and financial risk management. This roadmap provides a structured learning path, covering key topics, recommended resources, and professional certifications.
